I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Max Simchowitz](https://msimchowitz.github.io/). My research interests lie broadly in reinforcement learning, optimization, generative modeling, and control. Specifically, I study RL dynamics, understanding the fundamental principles of RL that govern modern AI systems, to enable stable, predictive, and continually improving training pipelines.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. As an undergraduate, I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Ping-Chun Hsieh](https://pinghsieh.github.io/), focusing on convergence guarantees in reinforcement learning.
