I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Max Simchowitz](https://msimchowitz.github.io/). My research interests lie broadly in reinforcement learning, control, generative modeling, and optimization. Specifically, I am interested in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of generative modeling for reinforcement learning and control.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. As an undergraduate, I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Ping-Chun Hsieh](https://pinghsieh.github.io/), focusing on convergence guarantees in reinforcement learning.
