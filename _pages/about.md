I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Max Simchowitz](https://msimchowitz.github.io/). My research interests mainly focuses on reinforcement learning, control, generative modeling, and optimization. Specifically, I am drawn to the mathematical and algorithmic foundation of generative modeling for reinforcement learning and control.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. I worked on my undergraduate research with Prof. [Ping-Chun Hsieh](https://pinghsieh.github.io/).
